### Assume that I am a data scientist working for laundry-pick up service startup. It's a small startup, so wants to build vast network in smaller cities to have a competitive edge over big companies. It recently opened 10 new stores and has two separate sales regions.

#### 1. Identify which of the two sales regions is performing better (outperforms in at least two of the metrics than the other)
- AVG Revenue per city
- AVG marketing spend per city
- AVG ROMI per city (revenue/marketing spend)

#### 2. identify which of the 10 new locations have the best potential for the company to invest more funds into marketing.
